# DiscordCryptoBot
A Discord bot that can greet and direct message users, monitor server activity and reply to commands using the Binance API.

I will be adding to this bot in the near future.
I plan to include more server administration functions, and a function that produces a price chart of the desired cryptocurrency. 

API key has been removed for obvious security reasons but just enter your own if you want to run the bot on your own server. I plan to publish this bot at a later date
when I improve it to a level I'm satisfied with.
